        <h2>Teachers day</h2>
        <p>Good morning to the Principal, respected teachers, and my dear friends. We all have gathered here to
            celebrate the celebration of Teacher’s Day. <br>

            My name is Haaris Hassan. I am a student studying in class 7th, I want to share my thoughts on Teacher’s
            Day.<br>

            But, first of all, I would like to thank my class teacher for giving me the opportunity to give a speech on
            the great occasion of Teacher’s Day.<br>

            The topic of my speech is “Why is a teacher so important in our life?”.<br>

            Teachers really play an important role in the education and life of the students. Teachers usually become
            individuals with proper vision, knowledge, and experience.<br>

            The profession of teachers is more responsibilities than any other profession. The educational profession
            has a profound impact on the growth, development, and well-being of both the students and the nation.<br>

            The teacher has many important roles in the education of students, society, and the country. The development
            and growth of people, society, and country depend on the quality of education, which is given only by a good
            teacher.<br>

            Quality of education is very necessary to fulfill the need of politicians, doctors, engineers, businessmen,
            farmers, artists, scientists, etc. in the country.<br>

            Teachers constantly work hard to get through books, articles, etc. the necessary knowledge for society. He
            always guides his students and shows them the way for a good career.<br>

            There are many great teachers in India who have established themselves as a source of inspiration for the
            upcoming teachers.<br>

            An ideal teacher should be fair and polite at all times without being affected by humiliation. Teachers are
            like parents to all the students in the school. They try their best to maintain the health and concentration
            level of the students.<br>

            They also encourage their students to participate in extra-curricular activities apart from studies to
            improve their mental level.<br>

            The purpose of saying all this is that a student is incomplete without his teacher. We should respect our
            teachers, we should understand their importance<br>

            For all students, Teacher’s Day is a celebration and occasion to pay respect and gratitude to their teachers
            for their continuous, selfless, and precious efforts in shaping their future. They are the reason for the
            untiring efforts made for enriching the quality education system in the country.<br>

            Our teachers do not consider us less than our own children and teach us diligently. As a child, when we need
            inspiration and encouragement, which we definitely get from our teachers. They teach us to get out of any
            bad situation in life through wisdom and patience. Dear teachers, we all will be truly grateful to you
            always.<br>

            Now I am going to conclude my speech, thank you all for being here and making this program a success.<br>
